# Changelog

All notable changes to little-coder are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and little-coder's public interface (CLI, providers, tools, skills) follows semver starting at `v0.0.1` post-rename.

## [v0.1.2] — 2026-04-22

### Changed
- **Whitepaper link consolidated to Substack.** Every pointer that used to reference `docs/whitepaper.md` now points at the canonical published version: *[Honey, I Shrunk the Coding Agent](https://open.substack.com/pub/itayinbarr/p/honey-i-shrunk-the-coding-agent)*. The local `docs/whitepaper.md` stays in the repo as a historical artifact (git-based reproduction still works), but README, CHANGELOG `[v0.0.2]`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/benchmark-reproduction.md`, and the BibTeX `howpublished` field all direct readers to Substack.

### Community issues from the v0.0.x era — resolved by v0.1.0
The pi port addressed several open issues from the pre-0.1.0 Python codebase:
- [#2](https://github.com/itayinbarr/little-coder/issues/2) *"Unhandled errors when Ollama is not running + crash on accidental shell commands"* (advaitian). Both failure modes are gone in v0.1.0:
  - Provider connection errors (Ollama / llama.cpp unreachable) surface through pi-ai's typed error path and pi's TUI error rendering — no crash, clear message.
  - Accidental shell-command-as-prompt (`ls -alrt`) is sent to the model as ordinary input; pi treats it as a user message rather than executing. The explicit `!command` editor prefix is the opt-in shell channel.
- [#3](https://github.com/itayinbarr/little-coder/issues/3) *"Context handling with llama-server"* (cmhamiche). v0.0.x hardcoded context limits in `local/config.py`; v0.1.0 reads them from `.pi/settings.json`'s `little_coder.model_profiles.<provider>/<model>.context_limit`, which users can freely override (32 K default, 262 K is one settings edit away). Matches whatever `llama-server -c <N>` is serving.
- [#4](https://github.com/itayinbarr/little-coder/issues/4) *"multiple custom providers?"* (mpetruc). `pi.registerProvider()` composes — see `.pi/extensions/llama-cpp-provider/index.ts` in the repo, which registers both `llamacpp/*` and `ollama/*` in one file. Additional providers are added by extra `pi.registerProvider()` calls (or by dropping a `~/.pi/agent/models.json` entry, per pi's docs).

## [v0.1.1] — 2026-04-22

### Changed
- **Strip leftover `little-coder-pi` references.** The 0.1.0 cut had the working-name `little-coder-pi` leaking into a handful of cosmetic places. Everything now reads `little-coder`:
  - `AGENTS.md` H1.
  - `.pi/extensions/checkpoint/`: snapshot directory is now `~/.little-coder/checkpoints/<session>/` (was `~/.little-coder-pi/...`).
  - `.pi/extensions/extra-tools/`: `webfetch` User-Agent is now `little-coder/0.1`.
  - `.pi/extensions/browser/`: Playwright launcher User-Agent reads `Mozilla/5.0 (little-coder research agent)`.
  - `.pi/extensions/hello/`: startup notify message.
  - `benchmarks/tb_adapter/`: module docstring + per-task log filename (`little_coder.log`).
  - `benchmarks/rpc_client.py`, `benchmarks/aider_polyglot.py`: module docstrings.
  - `package-lock.json`: `name` field (package.json was already `little-coder`).
- **Terminal-Bench adapter display name.** `LittleCoderAgent.name()` already returned `little-coder` in 0.1.0 (the leaderboard (agent × model) pair is unaffected), but the adapter class docstring and log filename now match.

### Does not change
- Behavior. 81 TypeScript tests + 4 Python tests still pass, `tsc --noEmit` clean.
- Tool schemas, JSON protocol names, environment-variable names (`LITTLE_CODER_*`), or the whitepaper's mechanism contracts.
- Any in-flight long-running job: the leaderboard TB run launched under 0.1.0 loaded its extension code at startup and continues writing to the old checkpoint path for its lifetime — cosmetic only, checkpoints are best-effort and independent of task results.

## [v0.1.0] — 2026-04-22

### Changed — architecture port to pi
v0.1.0 is a ground-up port of the agent from a hand-rolled Python substrate (CheetahClaws/ClawSpring-derived) onto **pi** ([`@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) v0.68.1). pi provides the agent loop, multi-provider abstraction, TUI, compaction, session tree, and extension model; little-coder rebuilds every small-model mechanism on top of it as first-class pi extensions. The whitepaper's claim about scaffold-model fit is preserved — nothing that the paper or the v0.0.5 78.67 % run depended on is dropped.

**For reproducing the original paper result, check out tag [`v0.0.2`](https://github.com/itayinbarr/little-coder/releases/tag/v0.0.2) (commit `1d62bde`)** — the Python codebase that produced the 45.56 % mean is preserved at that tag. The 78.67 % headline is preserved at [`v0.0.5`](https://github.com/itayinbarr/little-coder/releases/tag/v0.0.5).

### Added — fifteen pi extensions under `.pi/extensions/`
- `llama-cpp-provider` — registers `llamacpp/*` and `ollama/*` as OpenAI-compat providers via `pi.registerProvider()`. `LLAMACPP_BASE_URL` / `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` env overrides.
- `write-guard` — overrides pi's built-in `write` tool with the exact Python `_write` refusal string, directing the model to `edit` on existing files.
- `extra-tools` — registers `glob`, `webfetch`, `websearch` (pi already ships `grep` and `find`).
- `skill-inject` — hooks `before_agent_start`, runs the 3-priority selector (error recovery > recency > intent, `_INTENT_MAP` exact port) and appends a `## Tool Usage Guidance` block within the configured token budget.
- `knowledge-inject` — scores algorithm cheat sheets against the user prompt (word=1.0, bigram=2.0, threshold=2.0); publishes `requires_tools` back onto `systemPromptOptions.littleCoder` so skill-inject can cross-reference.
- `output-parser` — exposes `repairJson` + `parseTextToolCalls` (fenced ``` ```tool ```/`json` ``` blocks, `<tool_call>` tags, bare JSON, trailing-comma/single-quote/missing-brace repair, JSON string newline re-escape). Hooks `turn_end` to detect text-embedded tool calls and nudge the model back onto native calling.
- `quality-monitor` — ports `assess_response` + `build_correction_message`. Detects empty responses, hallucinated tool names, repeated-call loops, and malformed-args sentinels; queues a correction via `pi.sendUserMessage({deliverAs: "followUp"})`, capped at 2 consecutive corrections.
- `thinking-budget` — counts `thinking_delta` chars per turn; at `ceil(chars/3.5) > budget` aborts the turn, flips `thinkingLevel` to `"off"`, and queues a "commit to an implementation" follow-up.
- `permission-gate` — ports `_SAFE_PREFIXES` bash whitelist (ls/cat/git log/status/diff, find, grep, rg, python, etc.). Blocks non-whitelisted bash in `auto`/`manual` mode; `accept-all` passes everything.
- `checkpoint` — first-write-wins file snapshots to `~/.little-coder/checkpoints/<session>/` before Write/Edit.
- `tool-gating` — execution-level enforcement of `LITTLE_CODER_ALLOWED_TOOLS` + publishes the list on `systemPromptOptions.littleCoder.allowedTools` so skill-inject filters its budget to the allowed subset.
- `turn-cap` — hard `max_turns` early-break via `turn_start` counter + `ctx.abort()`.
- `benchmark-profiles` — reads `.pi/settings.json`'s `little_coder.model_profiles` + `benchmark_overrides.{terminal_bench,gaia}` and publishes resolved values on `systemPromptOptions.littleCoder`; also sets `temperature` on the outgoing provider payload via `before_provider_request` (pi-ai defaults otherwise).
- `shell-session` — `ShellSession`/`ShellSessionCwd`/`ShellSessionReset` with two backends: **tmux-proxy** via `extension_ui_request` (the TB adapter routes commands back to the TB `TmuxSession`) and **subprocess** (`child_process.execSync`). Preserves ANSI-strip, 200-line head/tail truncation + duplicate-line collapse, `[exit=N cwd=… timed_out=…]` footer, pager neutralization.
- `browser` — Playwright-powered `BrowserNavigate`/`Click`/`Type`/`Scroll`/`Extract`/`Back`/`History` with per-session lazy `Page`, inlined Readability JS, 2 KB chunked extract with `{cursor, next, has_more}` footer, graceful degradation when Playwright isn't installed.
- `evidence` — `EvidenceAdd`/`Get`/`List` with per-session in-memory store, 1 KB snippet cap, UUID entry IDs.
- `evidence-compact` — on `session_compact` emits the `[Preserved evidence from earlier in the conversation follows.]` bridge follow-up with entry count. The Python version's `_PRESERVE_TOOL_NAMES` set is architecturally unnecessary in the TS port (evidence lives in extension state, not message history).

### Added — Python RPC harnesses (`benchmarks/`)
- `rpc_client.py::PiRpc` — spawns `pi --mode rpc --no-session` with explicit `-e <abs_path>` for every extension (pi's auto-discovery scans only `cwd/.pi/extensions/`, which fails when pi's cwd is an exercise directory). Demuxes events vs responses vs `extension_ui_request` on a reader thread; handles the TB shell-proxy sidecar. Passes pi's `--tools` flag when `allowed_tools` is set so tool *schemas* (not just execution) match the Python `_filtered_schemas()` behavior.
- `aider_polyglot.py` — Polyglot driver with per-language descriptors (Python wired, others copy verbatim from the v0.0.5 tag). Retry enabled by default. Results flushed atomically.
- `tb_adapter/little_coder_agent.py` — Terminal-Bench `BaseAgent` subclass, still Python, spawns `PiRpc(tb_mode=True, tb_shell_handler=...)` and proxies `__LC_TB_SHELL__` requests through a `_TmuxShellProxy` that ports the Python `_exec_tmux` staged-script sentinel-wrapper strategy verbatim.
- `gaia_scorer.py` — unchanged Python scorer.
- `smoke.py` + `test_rpc_client.py` — end-to-end smoke tester and pytest suite for the RPC client.

### Added — documentation
- `AGENTS.md` — pi's project system prompt (replaces Python `context.py`'s SYSTEM_PROMPT_TEMPLATE).
- `models.json` — reference/documentation copy of the provider registration; `.pi/extensions/llama-cpp-provider/` is the canonical source.
- `.pi/settings.json` — per-model profiles including `benchmark_overrides.terminal_bench` (`thinking_budget: 3000, max_turns: 25, temperature: 0.2`) and `benchmark_overrides.gaia` (`thinking_budget: 2000, max_turns: 30, temperature: 0.4, context_limit: 65536`).

### Removed
- The entire Python implementation: top-level `agent.py`, `tools.py`, `context.py`, `compaction.py`, `config.py`, `providers.py`, `theme.py`, `workspace.py`, `cloudsave.py`, `little_coder.py`, `demo.py`, `memory.py`, `skills.py`, `status_line.py`, `subagent.py`, `tool_registry.py`.
- Python subsystems: `local/`, `memory/`, `multi_agent/`, `skill/` (replaced by `skills/`), `mcp/`, `plugin/`, `modular/`, `task/`, `checkpoint/`, `voice/`, `video/`, `demos/`.
- Python tests under `tests/`, build files `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`.
- Deliberately not ported (out of scope for 0.1.0): sub-agent spawn/manage (`multi_agent/`), MCP client (`mcp/`), persistent memory (`memory/`), task tracker (`task/`), plugin system (`plugin/`), voice input, cloud session sync. These were already peripheral to the whitepaper's result path; users who need them can check out `v0.0.5`.
- Deferred (not strictly a removal — a scope-cut for 0.1.0): `deliberate.py`-style parallel reasoning branches on failure. The pi port relies on `quality-monitor`'s correction follow-up path for between-turn recovery.

### Validation
- **TypeScript:** 81 unit tests across 11 files, `tsc --noEmit` clean.
- **Python:** 4 pytest tests covering PiRpc startup, extension enumeration, env propagation.
- **End-to-end on `llamacpp/qwen3.6-35b-a3b`** (same config as v0.0.5):

| Exercise | Difficulty | Port result | Python run1 baseline |
|---|---|---|---|
| affine-cipher | easy | pass_1 / 42.5 s | pass_1 / 120.6 s (−65 %) |
| bottle-song | moderate | pass_1 / 79.6 s | pass_1 / 127.2 s (−37 %) |
| book-store | hard-but-35B-passed | pass_1 / 73.9 s | fail / 734 s |
| pov | hard | fail / 131 s | pass_1 / 401 s |
| variable-length-quantity | hard | pass_1 / 109 s | pass_2 / 432 s (−4× attempt) |
| connect | hard | fail / 326 s | fail / 739 s |
| zipper | hard | **pass_1 / 130 s** | fail / 670 s |
| wordy | hard | pass_1 / 113 s | fail / 370 s |

Net **6 / 8 = 75 %** on a deliberately-hard subset vs Python run1's 4 / 8 = 50 %. Two exercises Python run1 failed (`zipper`, `wordy`) now pass; one (`pov`) remains a regression within stochastic-variance territory on a tree-rerooting edge case.

### Fixed — two regressions caught during validation
- **Temperature was not reaching the model.** `benchmark-profiles` resolved `profile.temperature = 0.3` but nothing set it on the pi-ai payload. Fixed by having `before_provider_request` **return** a new payload with temperature injected (mutating in place is discarded — pi only adopts returned values). The fix turned `zipper` from fail to pass_1.
- **Tool schemas weren't filtered by `_allowed_tools`.** `tool-gating` blocked execution but pi still presented all registered schemas to the model. Fixed by having `PiRpc` pass pi's `--tools` CLI flag when `allowed_tools` is set; execution-level blocking in the extension stays for defense in depth.

## [v0.0.5] — 2026-04-22

### Added
- **Full Aider Polyglot benchmark run on Qwen3.6-35B-A3B.** 225-exercise end-to-end run scoring **177 / 225 = 78.67 %** with `llamacpp/qwen3.6-35b-a3b` (Qwen3.6-35B-A3B UD-Q4_K_M, 22 GB) via llama.cpp on an 8 GB laptop GPU, no network calls. That's **+33.1 pp over the Qwen3.5 9B two-run mean** (45.56 %) and places little-coder well inside the public leaderboard's top-10 band.
- Per-language results: JavaScript 89.8 %, Python 88.2 %, C++ 84.6 %, Java 76.6 %, Go 74.4 %, Rust 53.3 %. Every language improved by at least +23 pp vs the Qwen3.5 9B baseline.
- 63 exercises flipped `fail → pass` vs both historical Qwen3.5 9B runs; only 4 regressed in the same sense (16 : 1 progression-to-regression ratio) — the improvement is systematic, not stochastic.
- Full write-up with per-language tables, retry-recovery analysis, exercise-level stability, persistent cross-language failures, tool-use metrics, and reproduction instructions: [`docs/benchmark-qwen3.6-35b-a3b.md`](docs/benchmark-qwen3.6-35b-a3b.md).
- Raw per-exercise results: [`benchmarks/results_full_polyglot_run3.json`](benchmarks/results_full_polyglot_run3.json).

### Setup notes for reproducing
- Model: `unsloth/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-GGUF` `UD-Q4_K_M`
- Serving: llama.cpp built from source, CUDA 13.1, `-DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=120` (Blackwell)
- Launch: `-ngl 99 --n-cpu-moe 999 --flash-attn on --jinja -c 32768 -t 16` — the `--n-cpu-moe 999` flag is the key VRAM trick (keeps expert weights in RAM; only attention + shared-expert occupy VRAM → fits the whole 35B in 8 GB GPU headroom).
- Agent config: default v0.0.4 little-coder profile for `qwen3.6-35b-a3b` in `local/config.py`, small-model optimizations ON, 32 K context, thinking budget 2048 tokens.
- Runtime: ~27 h cumulative wall-clock across the 225 exercises; sustained ~38 tokens/s during generation.

## [v0.0.4] — 2026-04-21

### Fixed
- `/config` REPL command crashed with `TypeError: Object of type function is not JSON serializable` when the in-memory config held any callable value. The display dict now skips callables and keys that start with `_` alongside the existing `api_key` filter. Reported and authored by [@advaitian](https://github.com/advaitian) in [#1](https://github.com/itayinbarr/little-coder/issues/1); applied in [e9d0bf8](https://github.com/itayinbarr/little-coder/commit/e9d0bf8).

## [v0.0.3] — 2026-04-20

### Added
- **llama.cpp provider** (`llamacpp/...`). `llama-server`'s `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint is a drop-in backend alongside Ollama — no new streaming code, it reuses the OpenAI-compatible path. Point at any loaded GGUF via the `llamacpp/<name>` model prefix. Default endpoint `http://localhost:8888/v1`, overridable with `LLAMACPP_BASE_URL` or `config["llamacpp_base_url"]`.
- **Qwen3.6-35B-A3B model profile** in `local/config.py`. The April 2026 Qwen sparse-MoE (35B total / 3B active, 256 experts, native 262K context) is now a first-class supported model.

### Benchmark result for v0.0.3
- On a consumer laptop (RTX 5070 Laptop 8 GB VRAM Blackwell, i9-14900HX, 32 GB RAM) with llama.cpp + `--n-cpu-moe 999`, `Qwen3.6-35B-A3B UD-Q4_K_M` runs at **38.55 tok/s** generation, **77.94 tok/s** prompt processing. This is comparable to dense-9B speeds despite 4× the parameter count, because MoE keeps compute proportional to the 3B active params while experts stream from RAM.
- The `python/book-store` exercise — which failed Qwen3.5 9B in both full polyglot runs reported in v0.0.2 — **passes on the first attempt** in 86.1 s with `llamacpp/qwen3.6-35b-a3b`. The model correctly identifies the non-obvious `(5, 3) → (4, 4)` grouping optimization (two groups of 4 at 20% off beat a group of 5 at 25% off plus a group of 3 at 10% off) that the greedy solution gets wrong.

### Changed
- `providers.py` header comment and provider list updated to include `llamacpp`.
- Built-in prefix auto-detection still recognises `qwen...` as the Alibaba DashScope cloud provider; use the explicit `llamacpp/` prefix to route a local Qwen GGUF to llama.cpp.

### Preserved
- **Ollama remains the default local backend**. No changes to `stream_ollama()`, its thinking-budget-cap mechanism, the Ollama provider entry, the auto-detect prefixes for `llama/mistral/phi/gemma`, the `/api/chat` streaming path, or `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` env handling. Existing `ollama/...` model IDs continue to work unchanged.
- All tool contracts (Read / Write / Edit / Bash / Glob / Grep / Skill / SubAgent) and the Write-vs-Edit invariant are unchanged.

### Setup pointers
- Build llama.cpp from source with CUDA support (on Blackwell set `-DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=120`). Prebuilt releases may not yet include the Gated DeltaNet operators required by Qwen3.6.
- Launch `llama-server` with `-ngl 99 --n-cpu-moe 999 --flash-attn on --jinja` for the A3B model. The `--n-cpu-moe` flag keeps expert weights in RAM and puts only attention + shared expert on GPU — the trick that lets 35B total params run on 8 GB VRAM.
- See the provider docstring at the top of [`providers.py`](providers.py) for the full model-string grammar.

## [v0.0.2] — 2026-04-19

### Headline result
- `ollama/qwen3.5` (9.7B, 6.6 GB) + little-coder scored **45.56% mean (±0.94pp)** across two complete 225-exercise Aider Polyglot runs on a consumer laptop with no network calls. On the public leaderboard this sits above `gpt-4.5-preview` (44.9%) and `gpt-oss-120b high` (41.8%). A matched-model vanilla Aider baseline reached 19.11%.

### Initial public release
- Skill-augmented agent loop for small local models (gemma3, gemma4, qwen3, qwen3.5, qwen2.5, llama3.2, phi4-mini).
- Ollama provider with thinking-budget cap (stream-level token counting → abort at budget → retry with `think:false`) to prevent reasoning models from hanging on hard problems while preserving their partial reasoning.
- Multi-provider support (anthropic / openai / gemini / kimi / qwen / zhipu / deepseek / minimax / ollama / lmstudio / custom).
- 8 core tools + Write-vs-Edit tool invariant.
- Aider Polyglot benchmark harness (`benchmarks/aider_polyglot.py`) with per-language transforms, atomic resumable results, and per-run status dashboard.
- Full paper: [*Honey, I Shrunk the Coding Agent* on Substack](https://open.substack.com/pub/itayinbarr/p/honey-i-shrunk-the-coding-agent); two-run reproduction report at [`docs/benchmark-reproduction.md`](docs/benchmark-reproduction.md).
