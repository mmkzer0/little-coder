# Changelog

All notable changes to little-coder are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and little-coder's public interface (CLI, providers, tools, skills) follows semver starting at `v0.0.1` post-rename.

## [v0.1.12] — 2026-04-24

### Changed
- README opening now restores a direct pointer to the Substack whitepaper — *[Honey, I Shrunk the Coding Agent](https://open.substack.com/pub/itayinbarr/p/honey-i-shrunk-the-coding-agent)* — in the first two paragraphs, framed as "start there for the *why*; stay here for the *how*". v0.1.11's rewrite had relegated the paper link to the results table only; restoring it above the fold is more appropriate for a repo whose headline result comes from that paper.

No code or behavior change.

## [v0.1.11] — 2026-04-24

### Changed — README rewritten for the post-pi-migration audience
Community feedback after the pi port: new users weren't sure how to set little-coder up now that it's pi-based. This release rewrites the README around that concern, modeled after [pi.dev](https://pi.dev)'s terse, conversational style.

- **New lead**: one-sentence what-it-is + a "How it relates to pi" section that explains little-coder is `pi + 16 extensions + 30 skill markdown files + a Python benchmark harness` — not a fork, not a wrapper, just extensions on a plain `package.json` dependency.
- **Setup section reorganized** into clear steps: what-you'll-need → clone+install → serve a model (llama.cpp / Ollama / cloud) → run → (optional) benchmark. Each step does one thing.
- **New Troubleshooting section** for the failure modes new users actually hit: `pi: command not found`, `ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:8888`, missing API-key env warning, extension load failures, benchmark harness not finding pi.
- **Results table** instead of loose paragraphs — each published benchmark number with its exact tag, model, dataset, and link to the per-benchmark write-up. Paper result (v0.0.2), Polyglot 78.67 % (v0.0.5), Terminal-Bench 1.0 40 % (v0.1.4), Terminal-Bench 2.0 (in progress).
- **Architecture diagram updated** to show both `tb_adapter/` and `harbor_adapter/` (TB 1.0 + 2.0), both pilot + status scripts, and the extension count bumped to 16 (evidence-compact now included).
- Citation / Attribution / License sections unchanged.

No code or behavior change. `benchmarks/tb_runs/` and `benchmarks/harbor_runs/` remain gitignored; in-flight run artifacts from the current TB 2.0 run are not included in this commit.

## [v0.1.10] — 2026-04-23

### Fixed — critical status-script reward-field bug
- **`benchmarks/harbor_status.sh` added** with the *correct* field path for harbor's reward schema.
- Harbor stores the verifier reward at **`verifier_result.rewards.reward`** in each trial's `result.json`. My initial inline status queries were looking at top-level `reward` and `parser_results[0].reward` — both of which are `None` in every harbor run. The result was **every in-flight status check reported 0 % accuracy**, regardless of actual passes.
- Concrete consequence during the 89-task TB 2.0 run: I reported "0 / 11 = 0.0 %" and later "0 / 19 = 0.0 %" when actual numbers were **7 / 19 = 36.8 %**. Passes including `prove-plus-comm`, `pytorch-model-cli` (which failed on TB 1.0 — an outright port win), `merge-diff-arc-agi-task`, and four others were silently labeled failures.
- The running TB 2.0 run itself is unaffected — only my reading of it was wrong. `reward.txt` in each trial dir has always had the correct 0/1 value.

`benchmarks/tb_status.sh` (TB 1.0) is unchanged — TB 1.0's `is_resolved` field lives at the top level and that schema was being read correctly.

## [v0.1.9] — 2026-04-23

### Fixed — version string drift
- `package.json` has been stuck at `"version": "0.1.0"` since the pi-port cut, despite tags advancing through v0.1.8. Bumped to **0.1.9** and will sync on future tags.
- `benchmarks/harbor_adapter/little_coder_agent.py::LittleCoderAgent.version()` hardcoded `"0.1.6"` — meant run metadata would misreport the agent version for any future TB 2.0 submission. Now reads dynamically from `package.json` at import time, so it auto-tracks the bumped package version. Falls back to `"unknown"` if the file can't be read.

No runtime behavior change; corrects the metadata that ends up in `result.json` / leaderboard submissions.

## [v0.1.8] — 2026-04-23

### Fixed
- **`benchmarks/harbor_runs/` is now gitignored.** v0.1.7's commit accidentally included ~50 KB of fix-git pilot output (configs, verifier outputs, reward files). Removed from tracking, added to `.gitignore` alongside the existing `benchmarks/tb_runs/` entry. No user-visible runtime behavior change.

## [v0.1.7] — 2026-04-23

### Fixed
- **`benchmarks/harbor_pilot.sh` flag name.** Used `--task-ids` (TB 1.0 convention) where harbor expects `--include-task-name` for per-task filtering from a registry dataset. v0.1.6 shipped with the wrong flag; this release fixes it.
- **Reproducibility note: v0.1.4 did not actually commit `.pi/settings.json`.** My v0.1.4 commit message claimed `max_turns` bumped from 25 to 40, but I forgot to stage the settings file — only the test that asserts `max_turns == 40` and the Python default (`LittleCoderAgent(max_turns=40)`) went in. The **TB leaderboard 40 % run did in fact use max_turns=40** (my local working file had the change and the running `pi` subprocess read it on launch), so the published result stands — but anyone cloning v0.1.4 and running `vitest` would have hit a test failure on a vanilla checkout. The settings.json change landed correctly in v0.1.6; from v0.1.6 onward the setting is committed-and-reproducible.

### Added — empirical verification of the TB 2.0 adapter
- Ran `benchmarks/harbor_pilot.sh fix-git` against `terminal-bench@2.0` (difficulty=easy, expert time 5 min): **reward 1.0, 1 m 50 s**. First real-task confirmation that:
  - harbor's agent discovery via `--agent-import-path benchmarks.harbor_adapter.little_coder_agent:LittleCoderAgent` works.
  - The async `environment.exec()` ↔ sync PiRpc reader-thread bridge via `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe()` is functional.
  - Cwd tracking through the sentinel `pwd` append preserves stateful-shell semantics across tool calls.
  - pi extensions load cleanly in harbor's container environment.

## [v0.1.6] — 2026-04-23

### Added — Terminal-Bench 2.0 (harbor) adapter
little-coder can now run on the new **`terminal-bench@2.0`** dataset (89 tasks) via [harbor](https://github.com/laude-institute/harbor), the framework that replaced the `tb` CLI for TB 2.0. The TB 1.0 adapter (under `benchmarks/tb_adapter/`) is unchanged — it continues to target `terminal-bench-core@0.1.1` and remains the canonical path for the current leaderboard submission.

- **`benchmarks/harbor_adapter/little_coder_agent.py`** — subclasses `harbor.agents.base.BaseAgent`. Implements `name()`, `version()`, `setup()`, and async `run(instruction, environment, context)`. Reuses `benchmarks/rpc_client.py::PiRpc` verbatim — the only novelty is the ShellSession proxy:
  - TB 1.0 proxied `ShellSession` calls to `TmuxSession.send_keys(...)` (sync, pane-parsing).
  - TB 2.0 proxies to harbor's `BaseEnvironment.exec(...)` (async, stdout/stderr/return_code).
  - A new `_HarborShellProxy` class bridges PiRpc's sync reader-thread callback to the async `env.exec` via `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe()` against the loop stashed in `run()`.
  - Stateful-cwd semantics matched by appending `pwd` to each invocation and tracking the result for the next call's `cd <cwd>` prefix.
- **`benchmarks/harbor_pilot.sh`** — pilot launcher (one or more task ids). Mirrors the shape of `tb_pilot.sh` but calls `harbor run --dataset terminal-bench@2.0 --agent-import-path ... --model ...`.
- README headline lists the TB 2.0 readiness alongside TB 1.0's 40 % result.

### Dataset & install notes (not committed, local-only)
- Install harbor: `uv tool install harbor` (binary ends up at `~/.local/bin/harbor`; version tested: 0.4.0).
- Download TB 2.0 tasks locally for inspection: `harbor dataset download terminal-bench@2.0` — 89 tasks, different layout from TB 1.0 (`task.toml` + `instruction.md` + `environment/` + `tests/` per task; no `.docs/instructions.md`). The download landed at `/home/itay-inbar/Documents/terminal-bench-2.0-tasks/` in my local setup.
- Task set is substantively different from v0.1.1 — no `hello-world`, new families (DNA assembly, compiler verification, kernel debugging, cobol-modernization, feal-cryptanalysis). Pilot-suitable easy candidates will emerge from the first runs.

### Pending before a submission run
- Empirical pilot on 3–5 TB 2.0 tasks to validate the async-exec proxy + cwd tracking under real tasks.
- Leaderboard submission URL / process for TB 2.0 (harbor docs don't yet specify — may differ from the TB 1.0 email-based path).

## [v0.1.5] — 2026-04-23

### Added — Terminal-Bench-Core v0.1.1 result documentation
- **little-coder on Terminal-Bench scored 32 / 80 = 40.0 %** on the full leaderboard-valid `terminal-bench-core@0.1.1` set. Single attempt per task, 6 h 50 min wall clock on an 8 GB RTX 5070 Laptop GPU.
- Run ID `leaderboard-2026-04-23__00-14-03`, executed with [`v0.1.4`](https://github.com/itayinbarr/little-coder/releases/tag/v0.1.4) commit `f4c1b4e`.
- Full write-up with passed/failed task breakdown, turn-cap analysis, extension-activity telemetry, thinking-budget correlation, and v0.2 levers: [`docs/benchmark-terminal-bench-v0.1.1.md`](docs/benchmark-terminal-bench-v0.1.1.md).
- README headline section now lists the TB result alongside the Polyglot headlines.

### Key empirical findings from the run
- The v0.1.4 `max_turns` bump (25 → 40) was empirically correct: cap-hits dropped from ~20 / 80 (projected at 25) to **8 / 80** at 40, and the 72 non-cap tasks passed at **43 %**.
- `skill-inject` fires on 71 / 80 tasks (first runtime-verified evidence that the error-recovery / recency / intent selection is actively engaging per turn — previously silent pre-v0.1.4).
- `thinking-budget` caps fired on 11 tasks — **all 11 failed**. Either selection bias (hard tasks think more, also fail more) or the 3000-token cap is cutting productive reasoning. The v0.2 experiment is to bump TB `thinking_budget` to 5000 and re-run.
- Quality-monitor corrections fired 57 times across 28 tasks, but none of the top-10-most-corrected tasks passed. On TB's long-horizon container debugging, mid-trajectory recovery is harder than on Polyglot.

### Known diagnostic gaps (for v0.2)
- `AgentResult.total_input_tokens` / `total_output_tokens` come through as `0` — the TB adapter doesn't forward pi-ai's usage reports. Cosmetic for leaderboard display but worth fixing.
- 12 failures were `agent_timeout` (harness wall clock), not `unset` (wrong answer) — these are tasks where turn count is fine but each turn is slow.
- `blind-maze-explorer-algorithm.*` (all three variants) failed despite passing the simpler `blind-maze-explorer-5x5` — candidate for a maze-search knowledge entry.

## [v0.1.4] — 2026-04-23

### Added — extension-activity observability
Extensions that were previously silent now emit `ctx.ui.notify` events per decision. The RPC client captures them, the TB adapter persists them per-task, and `tb_status.sh` aggregates them. This closes the diagnostic gap surfaced while the first leaderboard run was in flight — specifically, there was no way to confirm that `skill-inject`'s error-recovery priority was actually firing on failed tool calls.

- `skill-inject` — emits `skill-inject: +N [tool,tool,…]` whenever it injects; captures error-recovery vs recency vs intent selection for later analysis.
- `knowledge-inject` — emits `knowledge-inject: +N [topic,topic,…]` when a knowledge entry scores ≥ threshold and fits the budget.
- Existing `thinking-budget`, `quality-monitor`, `turn-cap`, `evidence-compact`, `output-parser` notify events were already there, now surfaced in the metrics.
- `benchmarks/rpc_client.py::PiRpc.notifications()` — new public method returning accumulated notify events.
- `benchmarks/tb_adapter/little_coder_agent.py` — writes a `=== pi notifications (N) ===` block to each task's `little_coder.log`.
- `benchmarks/tb_status.sh` — new `── metrics ──` section: tool calls per task (avg/median/min/max), turn-cap hits, tool breakdown, per-extension fire counts. Gracefully prints `N/A` for runs launched against pre-0.1.4 code.

### Changed — Terminal-Bench turn-cap: 25 → 40
`benchmark_overrides.terminal_bench.max_turns` raised from **25 to 40** in `.pi/settings.json`, and the default `LittleCoderAgent(max_turns=)` kwarg bumped to match.

Empirical basis: the first 10 tasks of the v0.1.1 leaderboard-valid run hit 25 calls in **5/10 cases** — all five were on failed tasks, strongly suggesting the cap (not the model) was the binding constraint. The 2 passes used 15 and 23 turns, both under 25 and well under 40. The new headroom costs nothing on passes and gives failing trajectories room to recover.

### Does not change
- `gaia` max_turns remains at 30 (different workload, different budget — revisit if GAIA fails similarly).
- Polyglot has no `max_turns` override (Python runs use pi's default, typically ~50).
- Tool schemas, protocol, environment-variable names, other benchmark_overrides fields.

## [v0.1.3] — 2026-04-22

### Added
- `benchmarks/tb_status.sh` — one-shot status dump for an in-flight Terminal-Bench run. Prints process health, elapsed/ETA, completed/remaining counts, current accuracy, per-task pass/fail list, and the currently in-flight container. Auto-detects the newest `leaderboard-*` or `full-*` run dir; accepts an explicit run-id as an argument or `RUN_ID` env var.

## [v0.1.2] — 2026-04-22

### Changed
- **Whitepaper link consolidated to Substack.** Every pointer that used to reference `docs/whitepaper.md` now points at the canonical published version: *[Honey, I Shrunk the Coding Agent](https://open.substack.com/pub/itayinbarr/p/honey-i-shrunk-the-coding-agent)*. The local `docs/whitepaper.md` stays in the repo as a historical artifact (git-based reproduction still works), but README, CHANGELOG `[v0.0.2]`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/benchmark-reproduction.md`, and the BibTeX `howpublished` field all direct readers to Substack.

### Community issues from the v0.0.x era — resolved by v0.1.0
The pi port addressed several open issues from the pre-0.1.0 Python codebase:
- [#2](https://github.com/itayinbarr/little-coder/issues/2) *"Unhandled errors when Ollama is not running + crash on accidental shell commands"* (advaitian). Both failure modes are gone in v0.1.0:
  - Provider connection errors (Ollama / llama.cpp unreachable) surface through pi-ai's typed error path and pi's TUI error rendering — no crash, clear message.
  - Accidental shell-command-as-prompt (`ls -alrt`) is sent to the model as ordinary input; pi treats it as a user message rather than executing. The explicit `!command` editor prefix is the opt-in shell channel.
- [#3](https://github.com/itayinbarr/little-coder/issues/3) *"Context handling with llama-server"* (cmhamiche). v0.0.x hardcoded context limits in `local/config.py`; v0.1.0 reads them from `.pi/settings.json`'s `little_coder.model_profiles.<provider>/<model>.context_limit`, which users can freely override (32 K default, 262 K is one settings edit away). Matches whatever `llama-server -c <N>` is serving.
- [#4](https://github.com/itayinbarr/little-coder/issues/4) *"multiple custom providers?"* (mpetruc). `pi.registerProvider()` composes — see `.pi/extensions/llama-cpp-provider/index.ts` in the repo, which registers both `llamacpp/*` and `ollama/*` in one file. Additional providers are added by extra `pi.registerProvider()` calls (or by dropping a `~/.pi/agent/models.json` entry, per pi's docs).

## [v0.1.1] — 2026-04-22

### Changed
- **Strip leftover `little-coder-pi` references.** The 0.1.0 cut had the working-name `little-coder-pi` leaking into a handful of cosmetic places. Everything now reads `little-coder`:
  - `AGENTS.md` H1.
  - `.pi/extensions/checkpoint/`: snapshot directory is now `~/.little-coder/checkpoints/<session>/` (was `~/.little-coder-pi/...`).
  - `.pi/extensions/extra-tools/`: `webfetch` User-Agent is now `little-coder/0.1`.
  - `.pi/extensions/browser/`: Playwright launcher User-Agent reads `Mozilla/5.0 (little-coder research agent)`.
  - `.pi/extensions/hello/`: startup notify message.
  - `benchmarks/tb_adapter/`: module docstring + per-task log filename (`little_coder.log`).
  - `benchmarks/rpc_client.py`, `benchmarks/aider_polyglot.py`: module docstrings.
  - `package-lock.json`: `name` field (package.json was already `little-coder`).
- **Terminal-Bench adapter display name.** `LittleCoderAgent.name()` already returned `little-coder` in 0.1.0 (the leaderboard (agent × model) pair is unaffected), but the adapter class docstring and log filename now match.

### Does not change
- Behavior. 81 TypeScript tests + 4 Python tests still pass, `tsc --noEmit` clean.
- Tool schemas, JSON protocol names, environment-variable names (`LITTLE_CODER_*`), or the whitepaper's mechanism contracts.
- Any in-flight long-running job: the leaderboard TB run launched under 0.1.0 loaded its extension code at startup and continues writing to the old checkpoint path for its lifetime — cosmetic only, checkpoints are best-effort and independent of task results.

## [v0.1.0] — 2026-04-22

### Changed — architecture port to pi
v0.1.0 is a ground-up port of the agent from a hand-rolled Python substrate (CheetahClaws/ClawSpring-derived) onto **pi** ([`@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) v0.68.1). pi provides the agent loop, multi-provider abstraction, TUI, compaction, session tree, and extension model; little-coder rebuilds every small-model mechanism on top of it as first-class pi extensions. The whitepaper's claim about scaffold-model fit is preserved — nothing that the paper or the v0.0.5 78.67 % run depended on is dropped.

**For reproducing the original paper result, check out tag [`v0.0.2`](https://github.com/itayinbarr/little-coder/releases/tag/v0.0.2) (commit `1d62bde`)** — the Python codebase that produced the 45.56 % mean is preserved at that tag. The 78.67 % headline is preserved at [`v0.0.5`](https://github.com/itayinbarr/little-coder/releases/tag/v0.0.5).

### Added — fifteen pi extensions under `.pi/extensions/`
- `llama-cpp-provider` — registers `llamacpp/*` and `ollama/*` as OpenAI-compat providers via `pi.registerProvider()`. `LLAMACPP_BASE_URL` / `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` env overrides.
- `write-guard` — overrides pi's built-in `write` tool with the exact Python `_write` refusal string, directing the model to `edit` on existing files.
- `extra-tools` — registers `glob`, `webfetch`, `websearch` (pi already ships `grep` and `find`).
- `skill-inject` — hooks `before_agent_start`, runs the 3-priority selector (error recovery > recency > intent, `_INTENT_MAP` exact port) and appends a `## Tool Usage Guidance` block within the configured token budget.
- `knowledge-inject` — scores algorithm cheat sheets against the user prompt (word=1.0, bigram=2.0, threshold=2.0); publishes `requires_tools` back onto `systemPromptOptions.littleCoder` so skill-inject can cross-reference.
- `output-parser` — exposes `repairJson` + `parseTextToolCalls` (fenced ``` ```tool ```/`json` ``` blocks, `<tool_call>` tags, bare JSON, trailing-comma/single-quote/missing-brace repair, JSON string newline re-escape). Hooks `turn_end` to detect text-embedded tool calls and nudge the model back onto native calling.
- `quality-monitor` — ports `assess_response` + `build_correction_message`. Detects empty responses, hallucinated tool names, repeated-call loops, and malformed-args sentinels; queues a correction via `pi.sendUserMessage({deliverAs: "followUp"})`, capped at 2 consecutive corrections.
- `thinking-budget` — counts `thinking_delta` chars per turn; at `ceil(chars/3.5) > budget` aborts the turn, flips `thinkingLevel` to `"off"`, and queues a "commit to an implementation" follow-up.
- `permission-gate` — ports `_SAFE_PREFIXES` bash whitelist (ls/cat/git log/status/diff, find, grep, rg, python, etc.). Blocks non-whitelisted bash in `auto`/`manual` mode; `accept-all` passes everything.
- `checkpoint` — first-write-wins file snapshots to `~/.little-coder/checkpoints/<session>/` before Write/Edit.
- `tool-gating` — execution-level enforcement of `LITTLE_CODER_ALLOWED_TOOLS` + publishes the list on `systemPromptOptions.littleCoder.allowedTools` so skill-inject filters its budget to the allowed subset.
- `turn-cap` — hard `max_turns` early-break via `turn_start` counter + `ctx.abort()`.
- `benchmark-profiles` — reads `.pi/settings.json`'s `little_coder.model_profiles` + `benchmark_overrides.{terminal_bench,gaia}` and publishes resolved values on `systemPromptOptions.littleCoder`; also sets `temperature` on the outgoing provider payload via `before_provider_request` (pi-ai defaults otherwise).
- `shell-session` — `ShellSession`/`ShellSessionCwd`/`ShellSessionReset` with two backends: **tmux-proxy** via `extension_ui_request` (the TB adapter routes commands back to the TB `TmuxSession`) and **subprocess** (`child_process.execSync`). Preserves ANSI-strip, 200-line head/tail truncation + duplicate-line collapse, `[exit=N cwd=… timed_out=…]` footer, pager neutralization.
- `browser` — Playwright-powered `BrowserNavigate`/`Click`/`Type`/`Scroll`/`Extract`/`Back`/`History` with per-session lazy `Page`, inlined Readability JS, 2 KB chunked extract with `{cursor, next, has_more}` footer, graceful degradation when Playwright isn't installed.
- `evidence` — `EvidenceAdd`/`Get`/`List` with per-session in-memory store, 1 KB snippet cap, UUID entry IDs.
- `evidence-compact` — on `session_compact` emits the `[Preserved evidence from earlier in the conversation follows.]` bridge follow-up with entry count. The Python version's `_PRESERVE_TOOL_NAMES` set is architecturally unnecessary in the TS port (evidence lives in extension state, not message history).

### Added — Python RPC harnesses (`benchmarks/`)
- `rpc_client.py::PiRpc` — spawns `pi --mode rpc --no-session` with explicit `-e <abs_path>` for every extension (pi's auto-discovery scans only `cwd/.pi/extensions/`, which fails when pi's cwd is an exercise directory). Demuxes events vs responses vs `extension_ui_request` on a reader thread; handles the TB shell-proxy sidecar. Passes pi's `--tools` flag when `allowed_tools` is set so tool *schemas* (not just execution) match the Python `_filtered_schemas()` behavior.
- `aider_polyglot.py` — Polyglot driver with per-language descriptors (Python wired, others copy verbatim from the v0.0.5 tag). Retry enabled by default. Results flushed atomically.
- `tb_adapter/little_coder_agent.py` — Terminal-Bench `BaseAgent` subclass, still Python, spawns `PiRpc(tb_mode=True, tb_shell_handler=...)` and proxies `__LC_TB_SHELL__` requests through a `_TmuxShellProxy` that ports the Python `_exec_tmux` staged-script sentinel-wrapper strategy verbatim.
- `gaia_scorer.py` — unchanged Python scorer.
- `smoke.py` + `test_rpc_client.py` — end-to-end smoke tester and pytest suite for the RPC client.

### Added — documentation
- `AGENTS.md` — pi's project system prompt (replaces Python `context.py`'s SYSTEM_PROMPT_TEMPLATE).
- `models.json` — reference/documentation copy of the provider registration; `.pi/extensions/llama-cpp-provider/` is the canonical source.
- `.pi/settings.json` — per-model profiles including `benchmark_overrides.terminal_bench` (`thinking_budget: 3000, max_turns: 25, temperature: 0.2`) and `benchmark_overrides.gaia` (`thinking_budget: 2000, max_turns: 30, temperature: 0.4, context_limit: 65536`).

### Removed
- The entire Python implementation: top-level `agent.py`, `tools.py`, `context.py`, `compaction.py`, `config.py`, `providers.py`, `theme.py`, `workspace.py`, `cloudsave.py`, `little_coder.py`, `demo.py`, `memory.py`, `skills.py`, `status_line.py`, `subagent.py`, `tool_registry.py`.
- Python subsystems: `local/`, `memory/`, `multi_agent/`, `skill/` (replaced by `skills/`), `mcp/`, `plugin/`, `modular/`, `task/`, `checkpoint/`, `voice/`, `video/`, `demos/`.
- Python tests under `tests/`, build files `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`.
- Deliberately not ported (out of scope for 0.1.0): sub-agent spawn/manage (`multi_agent/`), MCP client (`mcp/`), persistent memory (`memory/`), task tracker (`task/`), plugin system (`plugin/`), voice input, cloud session sync. These were already peripheral to the whitepaper's result path; users who need them can check out `v0.0.5`.
- Deferred (not strictly a removal — a scope-cut for 0.1.0): `deliberate.py`-style parallel reasoning branches on failure. The pi port relies on `quality-monitor`'s correction follow-up path for between-turn recovery.

### Validation
- **TypeScript:** 81 unit tests across 11 files, `tsc --noEmit` clean.
- **Python:** 4 pytest tests covering PiRpc startup, extension enumeration, env propagation.
- **End-to-end on `llamacpp/qwen3.6-35b-a3b`** (same config as v0.0.5):

| Exercise | Difficulty | Port result | Python run1 baseline |
|---|---|---|---|
| affine-cipher | easy | pass_1 / 42.5 s | pass_1 / 120.6 s (−65 %) |
| bottle-song | moderate | pass_1 / 79.6 s | pass_1 / 127.2 s (−37 %) |
| book-store | hard-but-35B-passed | pass_1 / 73.9 s | fail / 734 s |
| pov | hard | fail / 131 s | pass_1 / 401 s |
| variable-length-quantity | hard | pass_1 / 109 s | pass_2 / 432 s (−4× attempt) |
| connect | hard | fail / 326 s | fail / 739 s |
| zipper | hard | **pass_1 / 130 s** | fail / 670 s |
| wordy | hard | pass_1 / 113 s | fail / 370 s |

Net **6 / 8 = 75 %** on a deliberately-hard subset vs Python run1's 4 / 8 = 50 %. Two exercises Python run1 failed (`zipper`, `wordy`) now pass; one (`pov`) remains a regression within stochastic-variance territory on a tree-rerooting edge case.

### Fixed — two regressions caught during validation
- **Temperature was not reaching the model.** `benchmark-profiles` resolved `profile.temperature = 0.3` but nothing set it on the pi-ai payload. Fixed by having `before_provider_request` **return** a new payload with temperature injected (mutating in place is discarded — pi only adopts returned values). The fix turned `zipper` from fail to pass_1.
- **Tool schemas weren't filtered by `_allowed_tools`.** `tool-gating` blocked execution but pi still presented all registered schemas to the model. Fixed by having `PiRpc` pass pi's `--tools` CLI flag when `allowed_tools` is set; execution-level blocking in the extension stays for defense in depth.

## [v0.0.5] — 2026-04-22

### Added
- **Full Aider Polyglot benchmark run on Qwen3.6-35B-A3B.** 225-exercise end-to-end run scoring **177 / 225 = 78.67 %** with `llamacpp/qwen3.6-35b-a3b` (Qwen3.6-35B-A3B UD-Q4_K_M, 22 GB) via llama.cpp on an 8 GB laptop GPU, no network calls. That's **+33.1 pp over the Qwen3.5 9B two-run mean** (45.56 %) and places little-coder well inside the public leaderboard's top-10 band.
- Per-language results: JavaScript 89.8 %, Python 88.2 %, C++ 84.6 %, Java 76.6 %, Go 74.4 %, Rust 53.3 %. Every language improved by at least +23 pp vs the Qwen3.5 9B baseline.
- 63 exercises flipped `fail → pass` vs both historical Qwen3.5 9B runs; only 4 regressed in the same sense (16 : 1 progression-to-regression ratio) — the improvement is systematic, not stochastic.

### Setup notes for reproducing
- Model: `unsloth/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-GGUF` `UD-Q4_K_M`
- Serving: llama.cpp built from source, CUDA 13.1, `-DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=120` (Blackwell)
- Launch: `-ngl 99 --n-cpu-moe 999 --flash-attn on --jinja -c 32768 -t 16` — the `--n-cpu-moe 999` flag is the key VRAM trick (keeps expert weights in RAM; only attention + shared-expert occupy VRAM → fits the whole 35B in 8 GB GPU headroom).
- Agent config: default v0.0.4 little-coder profile for `qwen3.6-35b-a3b` in `local/config.py`, small-model optimizations ON, 32 K context, thinking budget 2048 tokens.
- Runtime: ~27 h cumulative wall-clock across the 225 exercises; sustained ~38 tokens/s during generation.

## [v0.0.4] — 2026-04-21

### Fixed
- `/config` REPL command crashed with `TypeError: Object of type function is not JSON serializable` when the in-memory config held any callable value. The display dict now skips callables and keys that start with `_` alongside the existing `api_key` filter. Reported and authored by [@advaitian](https://github.com/advaitian) in [#1](https://github.com/itayinbarr/little-coder/issues/1); applied in [e9d0bf8](https://github.com/itayinbarr/little-coder/commit/e9d0bf8).

## [v0.0.3] — 2026-04-20

### Added
- **llama.cpp provider** (`llamacpp/...`). `llama-server`'s `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint is a drop-in backend alongside Ollama — no new streaming code, it reuses the OpenAI-compatible path. Point at any loaded GGUF via the `llamacpp/<name>` model prefix. Default endpoint `http://localhost:8888/v1`, overridable with `LLAMACPP_BASE_URL` or `config["llamacpp_base_url"]`.
- **Qwen3.6-35B-A3B model profile** in `local/config.py`. The April 2026 Qwen sparse-MoE (35B total / 3B active, 256 experts, native 262K context) is now a first-class supported model.

### Benchmark result for v0.0.3
- On a consumer laptop (RTX 5070 Laptop 8 GB VRAM Blackwell, i9-14900HX, 32 GB RAM) with llama.cpp + `--n-cpu-moe 999`, `Qwen3.6-35B-A3B UD-Q4_K_M` runs at **38.55 tok/s** generation, **77.94 tok/s** prompt processing. This is comparable to dense-9B speeds despite 4× the parameter count, because MoE keeps compute proportional to the 3B active params while experts stream from RAM.
- The `python/book-store` exercise — which failed Qwen3.5 9B in both full polyglot runs reported in v0.0.2 — **passes on the first attempt** in 86.1 s with `llamacpp/qwen3.6-35b-a3b`. The model correctly identifies the non-obvious `(5, 3) → (4, 4)` grouping optimization (two groups of 4 at 20% off beat a group of 5 at 25% off plus a group of 3 at 10% off) that the greedy solution gets wrong.

### Changed
- `providers.py` header comment and provider list updated to include `llamacpp`.
- Built-in prefix auto-detection still recognises `qwen...` as the Alibaba DashScope cloud provider; use the explicit `llamacpp/` prefix to route a local Qwen GGUF to llama.cpp.

### Preserved
- **Ollama remains the default local backend**. No changes to `stream_ollama()`, its thinking-budget-cap mechanism, the Ollama provider entry, the auto-detect prefixes for `llama/mistral/phi/gemma`, the `/api/chat` streaming path, or `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` env handling. Existing `ollama/...` model IDs continue to work unchanged.
- All tool contracts (Read / Write / Edit / Bash / Glob / Grep / Skill / SubAgent) and the Write-vs-Edit invariant are unchanged.

### Setup pointers
- Build llama.cpp from source with CUDA support (on Blackwell set `-DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=120`). Prebuilt releases may not yet include the Gated DeltaNet operators required by Qwen3.6.
- Launch `llama-server` with `-ngl 99 --n-cpu-moe 999 --flash-attn on --jinja` for the A3B model. The `--n-cpu-moe` flag keeps expert weights in RAM and puts only attention + shared expert on GPU — the trick that lets 35B total params run on 8 GB VRAM.
- See the provider docstring at the top of [`providers.py`](providers.py) for the full model-string grammar.

## [v0.0.2] — 2026-04-19

### Headline result
- `ollama/qwen3.5` (9.7B, 6.6 GB) + little-coder scored **45.56% mean (±0.94pp)** across two complete 225-exercise Aider Polyglot runs on a consumer laptop with no network calls. On the public leaderboard this sits above `gpt-4.5-preview` (44.9%) and `gpt-oss-120b high` (41.8%). A matched-model vanilla Aider baseline reached 19.11%.

### Initial public release
- Skill-augmented agent loop for small local models (gemma3, gemma4, qwen3, qwen3.5, qwen2.5, llama3.2, phi4-mini).
- Ollama provider with thinking-budget cap (stream-level token counting → abort at budget → retry with `think:false`) to prevent reasoning models from hanging on hard problems while preserving their partial reasoning.
- Multi-provider support (anthropic / openai / gemini / kimi / qwen / zhipu / deepseek / minimax / ollama / lmstudio / custom).
- 8 core tools + Write-vs-Edit tool invariant.
- Aider Polyglot benchmark harness (`benchmarks/aider_polyglot.py`) with per-language transforms, atomic resumable results, and per-run status dashboard.
